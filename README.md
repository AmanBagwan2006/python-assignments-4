# Python Files, Exceptions & Errors - Assignment 4  

This repository contains my solutions for **Assignment 4 (Module 5: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python)** from the Tutedude Python Course.  

## Tasks  

### Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors  
- Opens and reads a text file named `sample.txt`.  
- Prints its content line by line.  
- Handles errors gracefully if the file does not exist.  

### Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File  
- Takes user input and writes it to a file named `output.txt`.  
- Appends additional data to the same file.  
- Reads and displays the final content of the file.  

## How to Run  
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Run the scripts using:  
   ```bash
   python task1_read_file.py
   python task2_write_append.py
